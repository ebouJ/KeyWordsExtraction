The A Day at the Races Tour was a concert tour by the British rock band Queen, and supported their late 1976 album A Day at the Races.
This tour was the first to use the song "Somebody to Love" and many others. "Brighton Rock" and "Bohemian Rhapsody" were performed in full for the first time. Also, singer Freddie Mercury performed a vocal canon to segue between "White Man" and "The Prophet's Song".
The opening act on most of the North American leg was Thin Lizzy. In New York City, the concert at Madison Square Garden was sold out within moments of tickets going on sale.
The final two shows on the tour at Earls Court was filmed and is widely traded among fans. These shows were of note as the band used an expensive lighting rig in the shape of a crown for the very first time. Both shows were also officially recorded on video and the first show was also released on many bootlegs in almost excellent quality. Both gigs included a Rock 'n' Roll Medley (this medley is also the only bootleg recording from the second night).
